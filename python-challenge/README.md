# python-challenge
This is where I will upload my Module 3 Challenge items.

Oookkkaaaayyy... first, I apologize to whoever is trying to grade this assignment because it turns out GitHub is fast becoming my archenemy!  

It appears I have now uploaded and committed duplicate files for the PyBank Challenge.  I believe all copies are truly duplicates of the exact same things.  My apologies.  I also had a typo for "PyPoll"... it initially committed as "PyRoll" with an "R".  Please ignore that folder.  I will attempt to upload a folder with the correct spelling.
Please tell me this process gets better (for both of us, ha!) in the coming assignments.  I never would have guessed learning the coding would be the "easiest" part of this course!  It's GitBash, GitHub, GitLab that are conspiring to kill me!!!  
Have a great week!
